# Covid-19
Project Description
The data used in this project will help to identify whether a person is going to recover from coronavirus symptoms or not based on some pre-defined standard symptoms. These symptoms are based on guidelines given by the World Health Organization (WHO).
This dataset has daily level information on the number of affected cases, deaths and recovery from 2019 novel coronavirus. Please note that this is a time series data and so the number of cases on any given day is the cumulative number.
The data is available from 22 Jan, 2020. Data is in “data.csv”.
